## Source Hierarchy

Priority order for this research (adjust per use case):

| Priority | Source | Access | Extraction focus |
|----------|--------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | Reddit | Public / API | Threads, comments, "rant" posts, workaround discussions |
| 2 | LinkedIn | Public / API | Posts, comments, job descriptions (implicit pain in requirements) |
| 3 | Twitter/X | Public / API | Tweets, replies, hashtags, quote tweets |
| 4 | Review sites (G2, Capterra, TrustRadius) | Public | Pros/cons, feature requests, complaints |
| 5 | Industry forums | Public | Support threads, feature requests, "how do I" |
| 6 | YouTube comments | Public | Video-specific frustrations |
| 7 | Support tickets / NPS | Internal | (If available) Raw, unfiltered feedback |

## Extraction Rules by Source

### Reddit
- **Look for:** r/[industry], r/[role], r/[tool], r/Entrepreneur, r/smallbusiness
- **Signals:** "Does anyone else", "Am I the only one", "Why does [X] suck", workaround posts
- **Extract:** Problem statement, context, emotion, what they tried

### LinkedIn
- **Look for:** Posts from target role, comment threads, job postings (pain in requirements)
- **Signals:** Rants, "hot take", "unpopular opinion", frustration with tools/processes
- **Extract:** Professional framing, industry language, implicit vs explicit pain

### Twitter/X
- **Look for:** Follow target accounts, hashtags, search queries
- **Signals:** Complaints, "I hate when", "Why is there no", comparison tweets
- **Extract:** Raw sentiment, brevity (often more honest)

### Review Sites
- **Look for:** Competitor reviews, tool reviews in space
- **Signals:** Cons section, "missing feature", "wish it had", comparison language
- **Extract:** Stated vs implied pain (what they don't say matters too)

### Forums / Communities
- **Look for:** Industry-specific forums, Slack/Discord communities
- **Signals:** Support threads, "how do I", workarounds, "I had to build"
- **Extract:** Recurring themes, language patterns

## What to Capture Per Finding

- **Source:** [Platform, link or reference]
- **Quote / Paraphrase:** [Verbatim when possible]
- **Context:** [Where, when, under what circumstance]
- **Latency signal:** [Why we think it's latent]
- **Power signal:** [Why we think it matters]
- **Demographic fit:** [How we know it's our target]
