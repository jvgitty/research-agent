## Detailed Findings

### Pain Point 1: [Name]
**Latency:** [1–3] | **Power:** [1–3] | **Evidence:** [Strong/Moderate]

**Evidence:**
- [Quote 1] — *Source, context*
- [Quote 2] — *Source, context*
- [Summary of additional evidence]

**Why latent:** [Explanation]
**Why powerful:** [Explanation]
**Opportunity:** [How this could be addressed]

## Methodology Note
- Sources consulted
- Limitations
- Suggested next steps (e.g. deeper dive on Pain Point 3)
```

## Depth Requirements

| Section | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| Executive Summary | Actionable; decision-maker can skim and get value |
| Each pain point | Min 2 sources, at least 1 verbatim quote |
| Opportunity | Not required for every pain point, but encouraged for top 3 |
| Methodology note | Brief; ensures reproducibility |

---

## Formatting

- **Clear headers** — Pain point names should be scannable
- **Quotes in blockquote** — Distinguish evidence from analysis
- **Tables where helpful** — E.g. quick comparison of pain points
- **No fluff** — Every sentence should add information

---

## What "Great" Means

- **Actionable** — A stakeholder could use this to inform product, positioning, or content
- **Evidence-based** — Claims are backed by research, not assumptions
- **Prioritized** — Reader knows where to focus
- **Honest** — Limitations and contradictions included where relevant
