# Pain Point Criteria

*Definitions of latent and powerful. Prioritization framework.*

---

## Latent Pain Points

**Definition:** Pain points that are *not* obvious — they're understated, emerging, or hard for people to articulate. They show up in:
- Off-hand comments
- Workarounds and hacks they've built
- "It's just the way it is" resignation
- Frustration that surfaces when something breaks, not in surveys
- Language like "I wish", "if only", "nobody gets this"

**Signals of latency:**
- Rarely appears in top-3 survey responses
- Shows up in long-form discussion, not quick polls
- Implied more than stated
- Tied to deeper identity or workflow (not surface feature requests)

## Powerful Pain Points

**Definition:** Pain points that *matter* — they drive behavior, emotion, or purchase decisions. They're characterized by:
- Strong emotional weight (anger, anxiety, relief when solved)
- Direct impact on outcomes (revenue, time, reputation)
- Recurrence (happens often, not one-off)
- Willingness to pay or switch to solve it

**Signals of power:**
- "I would pay for..." or "I switched because..."
- Intense language, caps, exclamation
- Mentioned in context of churn or switching
- Tied to core job-to-be-done

## Prioritization Rubric

| Dimension | Low (1) | Medium (2) | High (3) |
|-----------|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Latency** | Obvious, well-documented | Somewhat hidden | Highly latent, rarely articulated |
| **Power** | Mild annoyance | Meaningful impact | Decision driver, strong emotion |
| **Evidence** | Single source | 2–3 sources | Multiple sources, triangulated |
| **Actionability** | Hard to address | Addressable with effort | Clear path to solution |

**Target:** Prioritize pain points that score high on Latency + Power, with strong Evidence.

## Synthesis Rules

- A pain point must appear in **at least 2 distinct sources** to count
- Prefer **verbatim quotes** over paraphrasing
- Note **context** (where found, under what circumstance)
- Flag **contradictions** (e.g. "easy" vs. "impossible" for same thing)
