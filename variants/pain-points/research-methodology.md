# Research Methodology

*How to gather, synthesize, and surface latent + powerful pain points.*

---

## Workflow

```
1. SCOPE     → Load target demographic, define search focus
2. GATHER    → Query each source per source-definitions
3. EXTRACT   → Capture findings with quotes, context, signals
4. CLUSTER   → Group similar pain points across sources
5. TRIANGULATE → Validate with multiple sources; flag single-source items
6. PRIORITIZE → Apply pain-point-criteria rubric
7. SYNTHESIZE → Structure per output-spec
```

## Gathering Strategy

- **Breadth first:** Cast wide across sources before going deep
- **Depth on clusters:** When a theme appears 2+ times, dig for more evidence
- **Follow the workarounds:** People describing hacks often reveal latent pain
- **Negative space:** What do they *not* complain about? What do they assume is unfixable?

## Synthesis Approach

1. **Cluster by theme** — Group findings into coherent pain-point categories
2. **Name the pain** — Give each cluster a clear, actionable label
3. **Evidence per pain** — 2+ sources, verbatim quotes, context
4. **Score** — Latency (1–3) + Power (1–3) + Evidence strength
5. **Rank** — Sort by (Latency × Power), then by evidence strength

## Latent Detection Heuristics

- **"It's just the way it is"** — Resignation signals unarticulated pain
- **Workaround language** — "I had to", "I built a script to", "we just"
- **Comparison frustration** — "Why can't X be like Y" reveals hidden expectation
- **Identity language** — "As a [role], I..." — pain tied to role is often latent
- **Emerging vs entrenched** — New complaints may indicate emerging pain

## Quality Checks

- [ ] Every pain point has ≥2 distinct sources
- [ ] Verbatim quotes included where possible
- [ ] Latency and power justified (not assumed)
- [ ] Contradictions or edge cases noted
- [ ] Output matches output-spec structure
